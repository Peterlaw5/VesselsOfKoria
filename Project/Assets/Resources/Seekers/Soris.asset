  seekerDesc: "Healing magic is an art that requires years of practice and experience,
    but none of that matters to Soris: he was simply born with it. <br>Recognized
    as an utter prodigy by the monks of Shari\u2019laa, they believed that he could
    be the chosen one to learn the Way of Duality, a sacred art that stands between
    light and darkness, enabling its user to gain absolute control of both. <br>Soon
    enough, Soris proved them right: he mastered everything the monks could teach
    him\u2026 But that wasn\u2019t enough, as Soris was on the verge of stepping into
    the unreachable realm of the Gods. To fully master the Way of Duality, Soris had
    to tap into the arcane powers of the Island of Koria, elevating him to a state
    of semi-omniscience. <br><br>The last part of his journey is about to begin. "
