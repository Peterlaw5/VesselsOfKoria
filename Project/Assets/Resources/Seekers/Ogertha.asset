  seekerDesc: "<i>\u201CWhen Komuani, the great spirit of the Forlorn Steppes, perceives
    a threat to his domain, he chooses a protector.\u201D</i><br><br>Ogertha, the
    last of an ancient lineage of warriors, never cared much about prophecies: she
    learned to wield a sword before she was even able to walk, and that\u2019s all
    she needed\u2026 Or so she believed.<br>Everything changed the day she was defeated
    in battle by a nameless invader that raided her village, forcing her to escape
    while securing the lives of the survivors.<br>Alive with a shattered pride, Ogertha
    found comfort in prayer. That\u2019s when Komuani answered, prompting her to journey
    to the island of Koria. There, she would find the power to save her people and
    bring justice to her homeland.<br>She ran away once. It won\u2019t happen again. "
